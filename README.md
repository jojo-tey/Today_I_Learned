# Learning is never ending process :sparkles:

## What is this repo?

> This is a daily learning repository for prospective developers or developers to prepare for technical interviews. It didn't cover all the fields of development. I would appreciate it if you just refer to it as a guideline. Also, since I personally prepared the interview while preparing for the interview, there may be errors. We would be very grateful if you participate in these areas as Pull Request or Issue. It is also possible to add good reference material related to the topic. Please post any questions you may have while studying in the Repository!
